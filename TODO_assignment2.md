# data inspection:
- the turn number seems not "truly ordered"
- first letter was cut in the rationale (?)

# typo "theacher" --> "teacher"

# distilroberta:
- what are the start_idx/end_idx predicted by the Span Extractor?
- what is P (in the span extractor)?

# berttiny
- what is P (in the span extractor)?

validation/test
- missing results for distilroberta (all the other seeds other than 42, with and w/o history)


# All conclusions are missing for error analysis
- (if you "get unexpected answers" you can read the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07042.pdf to gain them and relate our displayed errors)
but i checked some of them and i think that some of the errors can be explained just by "googling"
